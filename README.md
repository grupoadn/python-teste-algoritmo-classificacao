## Contributions

This project was originally written by DadaScienceAcademy, however his involvement has shifted
as he is no longer using it.  As of 2019/02/20 further development and support will be done by Arnaldo Cavalcanti.

Pull Requests are the best way to fix bugs or add features. I know loads of you use this, so please
contribute if you have improvements to be made and I'll keep releasing versions over time.
